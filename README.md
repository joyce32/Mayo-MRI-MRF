# Mayo-MRI-MRF
Looking at MRI and MRF data from Mayo Clinic

Ongoing project with NCSA Genomics at UIUC

End Goal: predict biomarkers (such as Alzheimer's) from MRI and MRF 

My role on this Genomics team is to help explore the data with linear regression and principal component analyses. 

voxel_to_voxel_linear_model.ipynb explores a linear regression prediction MRF from MRI and vice versa.

MRI_PCA.ipynb is where I perform many PCAs on MRI data to see how many significant features are in the data and how well the images can be reconstructed using those significant features.
